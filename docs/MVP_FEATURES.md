# Tarefitas — MVP Features

> **An identity-complete MVP, grounded in neurodivergent UX research and Tarefitas’ core principles.**

This document defines the **minimum viable feature set** for Tarefitas that is:

* useful day-to-day
* aligned with neurodivergent needs
* coherent with the product philosophy
* safe from productivity-culture creep

The goal of this MVP is not to prove speed or growth, but to prove **calm usefulness and trust**.

## 1. Core Task System (Foundational)

### Features

* Create, edit, delete tasks
* Tasks support:

  * title

* engagement time
* usage frequency

---

## 17. Final Note

This MVP is intentionally **complete, calm, and constrained**.

It demonstrates that thoughtful UX — not pressure or automation — can meaningfully support neurodivergent users.
