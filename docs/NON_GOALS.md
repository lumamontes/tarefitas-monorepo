# Tarefitas — Non-Goals

> **This document defines what Tarefitas will deliberately never become.**

Non-goals are as important as goals. They protect users from harm, protect the team from feature creep, and keep the project aligned with its neurodivergent-first values.

If a proposal fits any category below, it is **out of scope** — even if it is technically impressive or common in other products.

---

## 1. No Productivity Scoring or Performance Metrics

Tarefitas will **never**:

* Score productivity
* Rank tasks by “efficiency”
* Show speed, streaks, or completion quotas
* Compare users to averages or benchmarks

**Why:** Productivity metrics create pressure, shame, and disengagement for many neurodivergent users. Tarefitas prioritizes well-being and self-regulation over output.

---

## 2. No Streaks, Guilt, or Loss Framing

Tarefitas will **never**:

* Use streaks that reset on failure
* Shame users for inactivity
* Use copy like “you’re behind”, “missed”, or “late”
* Punish disengagement

**Why:** Streak-based systems disproportionately harm users with fluctuating energy, executive dysfunction, or burnout.

---

## 3. No Prescriptive or Authoritative AI

Tarefitas will **never**:

* Decide priorities for the user
* Auto-schedule tasks without consent
* Reorder or modify tasks silently
* Present AI output as the “correct” choice

**Allowed instead:**

* Optional, explainable suggestions
* User-initiated assistance
* Easy dismissal without penalty

**Why:** Opaque or prescriptive AI reduces autonomy and trust for neurodivergent users.

---

## 4. No Behavioral Compliance or Therapy Claims

Tarefitas will **never**:

* Claim therapeutic or clinical outcomes
* Attempt behavior correction
* Replace therapy, medication, or professional support
* Frame users as problems to be fixed

**Why:** Tarefitas is a support tool, not a medical or behavioral intervention system.

---

## 5. No Urgency-Driven Design

Tarefitas will **never**:

* Use countdown pressure
* Highlight deadlines aggressively
* Force time-based prioritization
* Optimize for speed over comfort

**Why:** Urgency cues increase anxiety and avoidance rather than sustained engagement.

---

## 6. No Social Comparison or Competitive Features

Tarefitas will **never**:

* Include leaderboards
* Compare progress across users
* Gamify productivity socially
* Expose activity feeds by default

**Why:** Neurodivergent experiences are heterogeneous and not comparable.

---

## 7. No Mandatory Features or Locked Flows

Tarefitas will **never**:

* Force onboarding steps
* Require specific workflows
* Lock users into modes they cannot exit
* Make core usage depend on optional features

**Why:** Everything must adapt to the user — not the other way around.

---

## 8. No Dark Patterns or Growth Hacking

Tarefitas will **never**:

* Use engagement traps
* Optimize for time-on-app
* Use manipulative notifications
* Collect data for behavioral analytics by default

**Why:** Ethical design is non-negotiable, especially for vulnerable populations.

---

## 9. No Sensory Overload by Default

Tarefitas will **never**:

* Autoplay sounds
* Use flashing or pulsing UI
* Force animations
* Ignore reduced-motion or contrast preferences

**Why:** Sensory safety is a core requirement, not an accessibility add-on.

---

## 10. How to Use This Document

When reviewing ideas, issues, or pull requests, ask:

> “Does this violate a non-goal?”

If yes, the discussion should stop there.

Non-goals are **intentional constraints**, not missing features.

---

## 11. Final Note

Many productivity tools fail neurodivergent users not because they are broken — but because they pursue the wrong goals.

Tarefitas succeeds by refusing to chase them.
